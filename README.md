## Advantages of Using AI to Create the Game

Using AI to help develop this game provides several benefits:

1. **Speed of development** – AI can generate boilerplate code and complex logic much faster than writing everything manually.  
2. **Error reduction** – AI can suggest correct syntax and best practices, reducing bugs in the initial code.  
3. **Feature creativity** – AI can propose and implement advanced features (particle effects, power-ups, trails, etc.) that might take a lot of time to design manually.  
4. **Learning opportunity** – Developers can study AI-generated code to learn new techniques or coding patterns they may not have thought of.  
5. **Rapid prototyping** – AI allows developers to experiment with ideas quickly and see them working in real time.  
6. **Consistency** – AI can help maintain a consistent code style and structure across complex projects.
